crm_no_quorum_policy \- TODO

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBnoquorum_policy\fP TODO.

A cluster is said to have quorum when more than half the known or expected
nodes are online, or for the mathematically inclined, whenever the following
equation is true: total_nodes < 2 * active_nodes
Therefore a two-node cluster only has quorum when both nodes are running,
which is no longer the case for our cluster. This would normally make the
creation of a two-node cluster pointless, however it is possible to
control how Pacemaker behaves when quorum is lost. In particular, we can
tell the cluster to simply ignore quorum altogether. 
.br
Pacemakerâ€™s default behavior is to stop all resources if the cluster does not have
quorum (no_quorum_policy = stop). 

.B no_quorum_policy = stop
.br
node wont shoot anyone when it doesn't have quorum.
cluster will stop resources and will not be able to start it's existing
resources.

.B no_quorum_policy = ignore
.br
node will shoot anyone it can't see
cluster will not be able to add and start new resources.

.B no_quorum_policy = freeze
.br
wont shoot anyone when it doesn't have quorum.
cluster will not be able to add and start new resources.

.B no_quorum_policy = suicide
.br
node will only shoot itself and any other nodes in its current partition.
it wont try to shoot the nodes it can't see.
