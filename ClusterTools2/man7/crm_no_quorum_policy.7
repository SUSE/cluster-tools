crm_no_quorum_policy \- how the cluster should act in case of quorum loss.
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION

The crm basic parameter \fBno_quorum_policy\fP defines how the cluster should
act in case of quorum loss.

A cluster is said to have quorum when more than half the known or expected
nodes are online, or for the mathematically inclined, whenever the following
equation is true: total_nodes < 2 * active_nodes .

A two-node cluster only has quorum when both nodes are running, which is no
longer the case if one node fails. This would normally make the creation of
a two-node cluster pointless, however it is possible to control how Pacemaker
behaves when quorum is lost. In particular, we can tell the cluster to simply
ignore quorum at all. This is the recommended setup for two-node clusters.
Of course, exactly one node should survive in such a scenario. Therefor the
STONITH has to set up accordingly.

With more than two nodes, the cluster must not ignore the quorum loss.
For this multi-node clusters, an odd number of nodes is recommended.
Different policies are available to handle the quorum loss.
Nevertheless, STONITH has to be set up as well.

The following policies are available:

.B no_quorum_policy = stop
.br
Node wont shoot anyone when it doesn't have quorum.
Cluster will stop resources and will not be able to start it's existing
resources. This is the default, if nothing is configured.

.B no_quorum_policy = ignore
.br
Node will shoot anyone it can't see.
Cluster will not be able to add and start new resources.
This is the recommended setting for two-node clusters.

.B no_quorum_policy = freeze
.br
Wont shoot anyone when it doesn't have quorum.
Cluster will not be able to add and start new resources.

.B no_quorum_policy = suicide
.br
Node will only shoot itself and any other nodes in its current partition.
It wont try to shoot the nodes it can't see.

.SH EXAMPLES
.P
\fB* Two-node cluster\fR

Common configuration for the widely used Simple Stack, as well as for
SAP Enqueue Replication, and SAP HANA System Replication scale-up.
The stonith-timeout depends on the storage stack. 

property $id="cib-bootstrap-options" \\
.br
expected-quorum-votes="2" \\
.br
no-quorum-policy="ignore" \\
.br
dc-deadtime="20s" \\
.br
default-resource-stickiness="1000" \\
.br
stonith-enabled="true" \\
.br
stonith-timeout="150s"
.P
\fB* Multi-node cluster across two sites, with auxiliary node on third site\fR

Configuration for SAP HANA System Replication scale-out.
Since this setup is symmetrical across two sites, a third site with an auxiliary
cluster node is needed. This makes it work in case one complete site fails at once.
This so called majority maker node does not need to run any application resources.
Nevertheless, it needs access to all STONITH resources.
The expected-quorum-votes number is two times the total number of nodes on one HANA site.
The stonith-timeout depends on the storage stack. 

property $id="cib-bootstrap-options" \\
.br
expected-quorum-votes="31" \\
.br
no-quorum-policy="stop" \\
.br
dc-deadtime="25s" \\
.br
stonith-enabled="true" \\
.br
stonith-timeout="150s
