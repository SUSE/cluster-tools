crm_no_quorum_policy \- how the cluster should act in case of quorum loss.

.SH DESCRIPTION

The crm basic parameter \fBno_quorum_policy\fP defines how the cluster should
act in case of quorum loss.

A cluster is said to have quorum when more than half the known or expected
nodes are online, or for the mathematically inclined, whenever the following
equation is true: total_nodes < 2 * active_nodes .
Therefore a two-node cluster only has quorum when both nodes are running,
which is no longer the case if a node fails in a two-node cluster.
This would normally make the creation of a two-node cluster pointless, however
it is possible to control how Pacemaker behaves when quorum is lost.
In particular, we can tell the cluster to simply ignore quorum at all. 
.br
Pacemaker\'s default behavior is to stop all resources if the cluster does
not have quorum (no_quorum_policy = stop). 

.B no_quorum_policy = stop
.br
node wont shoot anyone when it doesn't have quorum.
cluster will stop resources and will not be able to start it's existing
resources.

.B no_quorum_policy = ignore
.br
node will shoot anyone it can't see
cluster will not be able to add and start new resources.

.B no_quorum_policy = freeze
.br
wont shoot anyone when it doesn't have quorum.
cluster will not be able to add and start new resources.

.B no_quorum_policy = suicide
.br
node will only shoot itself and any other nodes in its current partition.
it wont try to shoot the nodes it can't see.
