.SH EXAMPLES
.br
.TP
* Search for files and RPMs that might indicate components of SLE-HA are installed. Be pedantic with the search, but just print number of findings. A return code of "0" means "search went well, no traces of SLE-HA found".
# cs_detect_sleha ; echo $?
.TP
* Search for files and RPMs that might indicate components of SLE-HA are installed. Be pedantic with the search and print all findings.
# cs_detect_sleha --pedantic
.TP
* Search for components that might run without SLE-HA, but are supported only together with SLE-HA - f.e. DRBD, OCFS2, ReaR.
# cs_detect_sleha -s
.TP
* Uninstall substantial RPMs of SLE-HA. Some RPMs that are fetched as dependecies during installation will remain on the system. Also all files that are not handled by the RPM post-scripts will remain.
# cs_detect_sleha --uninstall
