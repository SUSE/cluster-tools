WARNING:
For change request / changes managenment / config chages in running productive clusters you 
need to take care of which resources will be affected by the wow calls. The resources might
be changed and thus restarted by the cluster. So you might have two config files. One for
the complete cluster and one for your change. The latter one must only contain the resources,
which have to been added.
